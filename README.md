# CDA Original Mini Factory Demo

## Install Instructions
- Not really much to do here

## Mini Factory Known Issues
- MPO oven not hitting inner reference switch to send signal its in the oven
  - To fix I have just been wiggling the sensor around until it hits 
- Vaccum lines coming undone underneath the MPO which causes various performance based issues
  - To fix just check vaccum fittings 
- HBW not going all the way up
  - To fix I just manually tuned the gear on the top until it reaches the top as the worm gear gets bound up and needs human internevtion 

## Hardware

## Maintenance
- March 2024 replaced the motor and gear box on the MPO oven
